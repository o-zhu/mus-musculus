#Question 6
#Aim: Add a curve to the weevil plot from question 3 showing the LGP distribution 


#load the necessary libraries 
#ggplot is used to generate plots in this exercise 
#RMKdiscrete is used for the dLGP function to determine the LGP distribution 
library(ggplot) 
library(RMKdiscrete)

#read the data 
weevil_data <- read.csv("mitchell_weevil_egg_data_1975.csv")

#set n() to be equivalent to the number of rows in the data set for subsequent code 
n=nrow(weevil_data) 

#pull out the count of beans with weevil eggs from the dataset 
total_count <- sum(weevil_data$C_count_of_beans_with_k_eggs)


#take the mean of the weevil egg counts
avg <- mean(weevil_data$C_count_of_beans_with_k_eggs)

#define lambda parameters 
L2 <- 0.5 
#this parameter chosen because it seems the organisms are over-dispersed 
L1 <- ???

#generate a plot of weevil data
#The Poisson distribution is in red 
#The LGP distribution is in blue
