QBio5 group for Challenge 4

We will check how the distributions of the three bug types fit to a Poisson or the LGP distributions.

# THE CHALLENGE 

1) Plot of the Poisson distribution with the same mean as the spider counts, along with the data 

2) Plot the Poisson distribution with the same mean as the sowbug counts, along with the data

3) Plot the Poisson distribution with the same mean as the weevil egg counts, along with the data 

4) Add a curve to Plot 1) showing the LGP distribution with the parameter hint below for the spider counts

5) Add a curve to Plot 2) showing the LGP distribution with the parameter hint below for the sowbug counts 

6) Add a curve to plot 3) showing the LGP distribution with the parameter hint below or the weevil egg counts

# RESULTS 

# Question 1 and 4 (λ2 = 0)
Poisson distribution fits the data nicely. The LGP distribution overlaps the Poisson. 

# Question 2 and 5 (λ2 = .53214)
Poisson distribution follows the overall trends but looks too rigid. The LGP distribution flexibility allows it to better fit the data. 

# Question 3 and 6 (λ2 = .50)
Poisson distribution almost overlaps with LGP distibution. LGP distribution seems to be drawn by one of the outliers in the data. It might be a good idea to remove these values and re-estimate.
